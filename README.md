# Hacknite
CODEBYTE'S PROJECT FOR HACKNITE
üåç Project Overview

This project aims to develop an integrated AI system leveraging remote sensing data, climate modelling, and urban analytics to optimize renewable energy generation and urban green space development. Our solution focuses on biodiversity conservation and environmental sustainability while harmonizing energy grids, ecological habitats, and urban infrastructure.

# Problem Statement
Urban environments face increasing challenges due to climate variability, pollution, and energy demands. Our goal is to use AI to provide actionable insights for resource management and urban planning, addressing the following:
1. Where and which renewable resources can be installed for optimal efficiency.
2. How to enhance green cover in specific regions to combat pollution.
3. Ways to improve biodiversity conservation and environmental sustainability.

# Libraries Used 
1. Pandas

# Project Workflow
1. Data Collection & Processing:
   We used datasets from Kaggle, focusing on three primary sources:

  I. a) Rainfall in India 1901-2015.csv

        Used for historical analysis and AI-driven prediction for 2016-2025.
        Cities selected: Delhi, Chennai, and Bengaluru (due to data availability).
        Kolkata and Mumbai were excluded due to insufficient data overlap.


     b) city_day.csv (2015-2020) 

        Derived monthly average pollution levels for Delhi, Chennai, and Bengaluru.
        AI-based prediction generated values for 2021-2025.
   

     c) Sunshine hours for cities in the world.csv 

        Provided monthly average sunshine for global cities (1961-1990)
        AI-driven sunshine forecasts for 2015-2025.
  
  II. Merging the above datasets to obtain "FINAL_DATASET.csv" using pandas.

2. Decision-Making AI (Bolt-Powered)
     Our AI provides actionable recommendations, including:

        a) Suggestions on increasing green cover based on pollution and climate conditions.
        b) Optimal placement of renewable energy sources (solar/wind installations).
        c) Website-based AI insights for urban planners and policymakers.
        d) Challenges and strategies for biodiversity conservation & sustainability.
